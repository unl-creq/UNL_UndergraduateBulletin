<p class="MsoNormal basic-text"><span>The Mechanized Systems Management (MSYM) major prepares students for delivery, management, and technical support of engineered systems for agriculture, food, energy, and water</span><span>. Students will develop technical, systems analysis, and management skills. This major is ideal for students interested in working with machinery and equipment systems from a practical perspective. The MSYM program includes hands-on course work in power and machinery systems, processing and handling equipment, and sensors and controls combined with coursework in business, management, agriculture, and natural sciences that prepares students for a wide range of careers in a variety of industries related to agriculture, food, energy, and water. The program offers four options for specialization: production, technical, business and processing operations.</span></p>
<p class="basic-text"><span><span class="basic-text">Students in the MSYM major benefit from small classes and personalized faculty advising. Students have the opportunity to work part-time in the Nebraska Tractor Test Laboratory and numerous departmental research projects. Students are encouraged to participate in student clubs such as the Mechanized Systems Management Club, and the UNL Quarter Scale Tractor Team.</span></span></p>
