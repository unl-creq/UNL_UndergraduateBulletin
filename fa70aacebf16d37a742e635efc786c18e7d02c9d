<p class="content-box-h-1">DESCRIPTION</p>
<p class="basic-text">Law is the system we use to ensure order and justice for individuals and communities within our society. The broad nature of the legal field allows people to work with the law in a number of ways. Litigation (trial practice), representative practice, legal planning, education, and adjudication (becoming a judge) are traditional ways in which people work directly with the law. However, a legal education is useful and may be applied to a variety of other fields such as business, insurance, government, writing, resource management, or publishing.</p>

Some students declare an academic major and earn a degree from UNL before entering professional school using their undergraduate academic program to develop the desired skill set for entry into law school and the legal profession. Students pursuing the Pre-Law category while earning degrees from any undergraduate college at UNL can receive guidance and advice from the Exploratory and Pre-Professional Advising Center <ins class="ins cts-1" title="Inserted by Jaclyn Gustafson - 10/9/2013 10:55am" data-cid="19" data-userid="669" data-username="Jaclyn Gustafson" data-time="1381334128570">(Explore Center) </ins>by declaring their pre-law category with their college advising office.</p>
<p class="title-1">High School Preparation</p>
