<p class="basic-text">Pre-Veterinary Medicine Program (PVET) is intended to academically qualify students for admission to a school or college of veterinary medicine, hereafter referred to as veterinary school. It is the undergraduate college-level preparation required for the successful completion of the professional veterinary medical curriculum taken at a veterinary school necessary to earn the doctor of veterinary medicine (DVM) degree.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Required PVET courses are specified by each of the individual veterinary schools, and although some courses are required by each veterinary school, there are some differences. The focus of the UNL PVET program is the courses required for admission to the Professional Program in Veterinary Medicine. It usually takes about three years to complete all of the required PVET courses.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students must meet the PVET requirements for each and every veterinary school to which they wish to make application. Required courses for veterinary schools may be found on their websites.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Generally, PVET courses must be taken for a grade, unless the course is offered only on a Pass/No Pass basis. Otherwise, courses taken Pass/No Pass do not fulfil PVET requirements.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The PVET Program is NOT a degree-granting program. It is intended only to help students fulfil requirements for admission to a veterinary school. All PVET students are encouraged to enroll in a baccalaureate degree program concurrently with the PVET Program. UNL baccalaureate degree programs in which UNL PVET students commonly enroll are Veterinary Science, Animal Science, Veterinary Technology, and Fisheries and Wildlife. But any baccalaureate degree may be perused. Students are urged to consult with their PVET advisor to explore their options.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students may matriculate at UNL in the PVET program, but they are expected to designate a baccalaureate degree major by the end of their sophomore year.</p>

<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">NOTE:</span> What follows fulfills the PVET requirements for the Professional Program in Veterinary Medicine (PPVM), a cooperative program between the University of Nebraskaâ€“Lincoln and Iowa State University. Criteria for admission to that program may be found on the PPVM website at http://vetmed.unl.edu/prospectivestudents. Students planning to attend other veterinary schools must check with those schools to determine if there are any differences between the other veterinary school and the PPVM PVET requirements.</p>
