<p class="title-1">Criminal History Background Check Requirement</p>
<p class="basic-text">The College of Education and Human Sciences (CEHS) has the responsibility to ensure that our students who interact with children served by schools or other agencies meet a high level of personal, professional and ethical behavior. Nebraska Department of Education policy requires that a person with any felony conviction or a misdemeanor conviction involving assault, abuse, neglect, or sexual misconduct shall not be allowed to participate in pre-student teaching laboratory and classroom experiences or student teach without approval of the State Board of Education. In addition, the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services standards apply to all individuals working in any capacity with pre-school children who are not yet in kindergarten. To comply with these two sets of standards, the College of Education and Human Sciences will require each student in a teacher education program to complete two formal reviews of their criminal history, which is conducted by the approved CEHS vendor. The first criminal history background check will be completed during the first semester of the student's entry into the College. This must be completed before the first field experience. The second criminal history background check will take place as part of the student teaching application process, culminating experience, or internship. Students are responsible for the cost of the criminal history background checks. If more than three years elapse after the initial background check is conducted, the College reserves the right to require completion of additional background checks. Eighteen months after the initial Criminal History Background Check, undergraduate students are required to complete the CEHS self-disclosure report. Graduate students will be required to complete the self-disclosure report at the same time as the initial background check is conducted and again eighteen months later.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students with any felony or any misdemeanor charges or convictions, as reported on the background check, will be contacted by the College and may be required to meet with the Certification Officer or with the Director of Professional Experiences. This meeting will be held so that the student can receive guidance with respect to the impact of the charge or conviction on the student's future in the College and the profession of education. <strong>If any new charges or convictions are acquired after any background check, students are required to meet with the Certification Officer or with the Director of Professional Experiences within two weeks after the event occurs. Failure to disclose any new information concerning one's criminal history can lead to removal from the program.</strong> A student's ability to continue to participate in any teacher education program in the College will be based on the type and number of convictions, the recentness of their occurrence, and whether these violate the standards of the Nebraska Department of Education and/or the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services. The standards that the College sets for its students may be more stringent than the rules of the Nebraska Department of Education or the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services. The consequences of one conviction compared to another may vary significantly, depending upon the facts underlying the convictions.</p>
<p class="title-1">Professional and Ethical Behavior: Avoiding Risky Behaviors</p>
<p class="basic-text">In addition to criminal convictions, other non-criminal behaviors which: involve risks that are unacceptable for future teachers and the children charged to their care; demonstrate a lack of professionalism and good judgment; and evidence a disregard for one’s personal reputation, the integrity of the College and the teaching profession, may bring into question a student’s ability to be successful in an education career. Before engaging in such questionable behavior, students must consider how the College, the profession, educational employer, parents of school-aged children, and the community of Nebraska would perceive or evaluate the impact of that behavior with respect to the student's ability to serve children. Teaching is a profession that requires its potential candidates to be individuals of the highest integrity. The College reserves its prerogative to evaluate students' fitness for the profession in its discretion, so that safety in the classroom, the reputation of the College, and the best interest of the student, are all recognized and promoted. Should the College, through the reasonable exercise of the judgement of its Certification Officer or the Director of Professional Experiences, determine that a student's individual behavior represent a lack of integrity, questionable moral/ethical character, or otherwise indicates a potential of risk to young persons and others in the educational community, the College of Education and Human Sciences may deny entry to or dismiss such a student from any program which leads to certification or to services of children in a community agency. More specifically, these kinds of behavior shall be adequate foundation to deny any candidate or potential candidate from participation in any practicum, pre-practicum, student teaching or similar field experience, since the interests and safety of the children and young people present in the classroom, schools and other practicum settings are paramount. Students will be expected to meet Nebraska standards for personal and professional fitness, as described in the Nebraska Application for Teacher Certification. The consequences for unprofessional, unethical or risky behavior will differ given the unique circumstances involved in each matter.</p>
<p class="title-1">Appeal to the Dean</p>
<p class="basic-text">Should a student object to the determination made by the Certification Officer or the Director of Professional Experiences with respect to a criminal behavior or unprofessional behavior, the student may appeal to the Dean of the College, in writing, within ten days of the determination, requesting the Dean of the College to investigate and review the determination. The student's written appeal shall clearly explain the basis for the appeal. The Dean will review the student's basis for appeal and is authorized but not required to look into related concerns, whether or not sure concerns are contained in the student's written appeal. The Dean shall render a decision on the appeal as soon as reasonably possible, but no later than 20 days following the initiation of the appeal. Once the Dean has completed the review and investigation, he or she shall deliver to the students and the Certification Officer or the Director of Professional Experiences a written decision, which shall be final and not subject to further appeal or review with the University of Nebraska.</p>            </div>
