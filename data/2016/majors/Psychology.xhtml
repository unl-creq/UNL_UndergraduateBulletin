<p>The undergraduate degree program in psychology is designed to provide you with educational and research experiences that can prepare you for graduate or professional school in academic psychology, medicine, dentistry, nursing, public health, and lawâ€”to name a few. The bachelors degree program in psychology can also prepare you for diverse careers in applied fields such as counseling, business, and health and human services. If you plan to major in psychology, we recommend that you meet with our advisors as early as possible to plan a program of study consistent with your interests and goals.</p>

<p>Graduate Work. Graduate programs leading to the doctor of philosophy degree in psychology are offered. A detailed description of these courses appears in the Graduate Studies Bulletin.</p>
