			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>The College of Architecture also administers the interior design program. The four-year interior design program consists of a one-year pre-interior design program and a subsequent three-year bachelor of science in design (BSD-Interior Design) major. After completing a one-year curriculum in pre-interior design, students apply for admission into the College of Architecture’s interior design program. This interior design program is fully accredited by the Council Interior Design Accreditation (CIDA). The interior design program also offers a post-professional MS degree through the Graduate College. The graduate degree is also available through On-line and Distance Education.</p>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>This four-year, undergraduate program is for the student interested in becoming a professional interior designer. The professional interior designer is a person qualified by education, experience, and examination to 1) identify, research, and creatively explore issues related to the quality of the interior environment; 2) perform design services in interior spaces, including programming, design analysis, space planning and aesthetics, using specialized knowledge of interior construction, building systems and components, building codes, equipment materials and furnishings; and 3) prepare drawings and documents describing the design of interior spaces in order to enhance and protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public.</p>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>Upon successful completion of one year of pre-interior design studies and admission to the interior design program, students in the interior design program may enroll in the curriculum which leads to a bachelor of science in design (BSD-Interior Design) degree.</p>
			<p class="title-1" xml:lang='en-us'>Common First Year</p>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>The Common First Year engages and prepares students for exciting futures in all design fields within the College of Architecture. </p>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>The Common First Year curriculum offered by the College of Architecture, introduces students to design through courses in three areas: Technique (drawing and computer applications), Design Discipline (an introduction to the related design disciplines and design history), and Design Practice (design Thinking and design Making). In addition, students take University courses in math, English, communications, and a general education elective. dThink and dMake are sequential hands-on courses where students learn to work in teams to address problems and promote innovation. At the same time, they learn the foundational skills in composition, craft, presentation, and idea generation necessary for all design fields. </p>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>At the end of the Common First Year, students have gained an understanding of the broad range of design and are eligible to apply to any of the design programs in the College—Architecture, Landscape Architecture, Interior Design, and Industrial Design (pending program approval).</p>
			<p class="content-box-h-1" xml:lang='en-us'>ADMISSION</p>
			<p class="title-1" xml:lang='en-us'>Admission to the Bachelor of Science in Design Program–Interior Design</p>
			<p class="title-2" xml:lang='en-us'>Minimum Entrance Requirements</p>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>To be considered for admission to the interior design program, applicants must:</p>
			<p class="list" xml:lang='en-us'>1. Be enrolled in the College of Architecture</p>
			<p class="list" xml:lang='en-us'>2. Be in good scholastic standing</p>
			<p class="list" xml:lang='en-us'>3. Have completed the appropriate 1st year pre-architecture, pre-interior design, or pre-landscape architecture program of study</p>
			<p class="title-1" xml:lang='en-us'>Second Year Admission Process</p>
			<p class="list" xml:lang='en-us'>1. An application for admission may be completed by filling out the online application. The program receives applications once a year on March 1.</p>
			<p class="list" xml:lang='en-us'>2. Applicants must submit a portfolio conforming to the defined criteria for the program applied for by the date posted at the completion of the spring semester.</p>
			<p class="list" xml:lang='en-us'>3. Any applicant who has previously applied for admission and has not been accepted or who fails to enroll in the professional program in architecture or the interior design program after an acceptance must reapply in the regular manner. Students may apply for admission to the interior design program only three times.</p>
			<p class="title-2" xml:lang='en-us'>Evaluation</p>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>The faculty of the interior design program will carefully evaluate the applications for admission. The committee considers three elements in their evaluation: cumulative grade point average, a weighted grade point average, and the portfolio of student work. The weighted grade point average gives additional value to the applicant’s achievement in the required DSGN prefix course or transfer equivalents in the pre-professional curriculum.</p>
			<p class="title-2" xml:lang='en-us'>Selection</p>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>Admission to the interior design program will be awarded to applicants who show the greatest professional potential and have demonstrated scholastic achievement. The faculty reserves the right to not fill all available spaces in the professional program in the interior design program if determined that the remaining applicants have not performed at an acceptable level.</p>
			<p class="content-box-h-1" xml:lang='en-us'>MAJOR REQUIREMENTS </p>
			<p class="title-1" xml:lang='en-us'>Pre-Interior Design Curriculum</p>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>The pre-interior design curriculum begins with a one-year design core. This core introduces students to the fundamentals of design thinking and design making. The pre-interior design program is followed by three years of interior design instruction leading to a bachelor of science in design–interior design. The interior design program is fully accredited by the Council for Interior Design Accreditation (CIDA).</p>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>The College of Architecture, and all four years of the interior design program, are located in Lincoln. However, we do offer the option to do the first year of the program at UNO. After successfully completing the prescribed pre-interior design program at UNO, students may transfer to UNL and apply for admission to the second year of study in the professional program of the Interior Design Program. For more information about courses at UNO, or transferring from UNO to UNL, please contact Dr. Betsy Gabb at 402-472-9245 (UNL) or Leslie Brehm at 402-472-4065.</p>

			<p class="title-2" xml:lang='en-us'>Pass/No Pass Limits</p>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>None of the required classes offered in the professional program are offered Pass/No Pass, but a maximum of 12 Pass/No Pass credit hours of humanities, social sciences, or open electives may be taken from departments outside the College of Architecture.</p>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>Courses taken outside the architecture, landscape architecture, or interior design programs to fulfill the upper level outside elective requirement at the 800 level or 900 level, with or without a 400-level counterpart, in a minor, collateral, or supporting area of work, can be taken on a Pass/No Pass basis.</p>

			<p class="title-2" xml:lang='en-us'>Product Design </p>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>The common core of courses shared by students in the College of Architecture (interior design, architecture, landscape architecture) provides students with an understanding of the design and fabrication process at a range of scales. The minor in product design provides an opportunity to explore design at a smaller, yet related scale. It allows students to develop academic strengths that will prepare them for advanced study and careers in the design of objects that people interact with on a personal level, of a size and function related to human dimensions. This includes furniture and a variety of manufactured objects.</p>
