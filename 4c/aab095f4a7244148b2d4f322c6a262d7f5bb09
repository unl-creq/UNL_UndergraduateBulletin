<p class="basic-text">The primary responsibility of the architectural profession is the design of meaningful, productive environments for human occupation and use. Architects, therefore, must be able to understand the needs and desires of the people who will inhabit and use their creations and then effectively synthesize the complex structural, mechanical, constructional components, and cultural references that go into the design of a building.

<p class="basic-text">The architecture program seeks to increase students’ desire to learn and to develop a capacity for design-thinking and sound, critical judgment while simultaneously developing their creative potential. Specifically, the curriculum provides the background and means for the student to:</p>
<p class="list">1. Analyze and understand society’s needs and desires,</p>
<p class="list">2. Translate these needs and desires into a physical form and spatial organization,</p>
<p class="list">3. Contribute creatively to the building construction industry,</p>

Students choosing to study architecture first enter the College as majors in pre-architecture. After completing a one year introductory design curriculum common to all undergraduates in the College of Architecture, students apply for admission into the architecture program’s professional program. The professional program in architecture consists of two components: the three-year <span class="basic-text-bold">bachelor of science in design </span>(BSD-Architecture) and the subsequent two-year <span class="basic-text-bold">master of architecture</span> (MArch).</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students in good standing at the completion of the BSD-Architecture are admitted to the MArch program without application.</p>
<p class="basic-text">In the United States, most state registration boards require a degree from an accredited professional degree program as a prerequisite for licensure. The National Architectural Accreditation Board (NAAB), which is the sole agency authorized to accredit U.S. professional degree programs in architecture, recognizes three types of degrees: the bachelor of architecture, the master of architecture and the doctor of architecture. A program may be granted a 6-year, 3-year, or 2-year term of accreditation, depending on the extent of its conformance with established educational standards.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Masters degree programs may consist of an undergraduate degree and a professional graduate degree, that, when earned sequentially, constitute an accredited professional education. However, the undergraduate degree is not, by itself, recognized as an accredited degree.</p>
<p class="basic-text"><span class="basic-text-bold">The bachelor of science in design is a para-professional degree and a necessary component of the professional program which culminates with the master of architecture degree. The master of architecture degree is the first professional degree. </span>The professional master of architecture degree is fully accredited by the National Architectural Accreditation Board (NAAB).</p>
<p class="basic-text">In addition to the normal two-year professional program, <span class="basic-text-bold">applicants with degrees from other fields may be eligible to enter the three year master of architecture program with deficiencies.</span><span class="no-style-override"> </span>These deficiencies are evaluated by the program director on an individual basis after admission resulting from a review of the applicant’s transcripts and other pertinent professionally-related materials by the Student Affairs Committee. Students in this three year program are required to complete 27 to 50 hours of selected undergraduate courses (a minimum of one additional year) prior to pursuing the professional program. Applicants with deficiencies exceeding 50 credit hours are not admitted.</p>
<p class="basic-text">For those who would like to pursue scholarship <ins class="ins cts-1" title="Inserted by Leslie Brehm - 11/7/2013 3:25pm" data-cid="159" data-userid="1135" data-username="Leslie Brehm" data-time="1383859551863">and research </ins>in architecture, the architecture program also offers a 36 credit hour, scholarly-nonprofessional <span class="basic-text-bold">master of science in architecture degree for students with a bachelors degree in architecture or a related discipline</span>.</p>
<p class="title-1">The Master of Architecture Professional Program</p>
<p class="title-2">General</p>
<p class="basic-text">The professional program in architecture is a six-year course of study that includes a one-year pre-professional segment, a three-year core segment culminating in the award of the bachelor of science in design (BSD) and culminates in the final two-year exploratory segment which results in the receipt of the professional master of architecture degree (MArch).</p>
<p class="basic-text">Although the bachelor of science in design degree is an integral part of the five-year professional program in architecture, it should be clearly understood that the undergraduate BSD is not a professional degree and is not accredited by the National Architectural Accrediting Board. Most state registration boards will not acknowledge any degree unless accompanied by an accredited professional degree.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The accredited, first professional degree awarded by the College of Architecture is the <span class="basic-text-bold">master of architecture</span><span class="no-style-override"> </span>degree which is awarded at the successful conclusion of the professional program in architecture. This is the only accredited professional architecture program in the state of Nebraska.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Upon successful completion of the one-year pre-architecture program, students who have been admitted to the second year may enroll in the curriculum that leads to the BSD degree and the MArch degree.</p>
