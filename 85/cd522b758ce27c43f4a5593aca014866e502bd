<p class="basic-text">Current majors and students considering a major in sociology should consult with a department adviser when registering for classes. This is particularly important because the subjects that lay the foundation for later training in sociology, plus the courses for a minor in another department, should be carefully selected. The adviser can also discuss focus areas, internships, and research opportunities.</p>
