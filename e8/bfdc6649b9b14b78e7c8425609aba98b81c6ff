<p class="faculty-list"><span class="faculty-list-bold">Director and Chief Adviser: Debbie Minter,</span><span class="generated-style"> 1223 Oldfather Hall</span></p>
<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The University Studies Program permits students whose career or educational goals cannot be achieved through listed majors to develop individual degree programs (BA and BS) in the Colleges of Arts and Sciences and of Fine and Performing Arts. Programs will be made up primarily of courses selected from those regularly offered by the two colleges and by other colleges at UNL but may also contain credit for independent projects, internships, life experiences, or educational programs not otherwise transferable to the University of Nebraska. Programs will follow the spirit of liberal education, even when they do not fulfill the specific liberal education requirements.</span></p>
<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Students should consult the director before applying. The application takes the form of a letter to the University Studies faculty presenting an appropriate educational and personal history, a justification of the focus of the proposed program, and a tentative listing of courses. Admission will be approved for applicants who present evidence of strong motivation and a capacity to pursue independent work, and who offer a rigorous and balanced program suited to carefully defined aims.</span></p>
