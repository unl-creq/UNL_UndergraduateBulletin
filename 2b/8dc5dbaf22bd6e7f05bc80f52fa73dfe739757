<p class="content-box-h-1">DESCRIPTION</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students who complete these two field endorsements are endorsed to teach children in all elementary subjects in kindergarten through grade 6, in all schools. They may also teach in grades 7 and 8 in self-contained classrooms. Self-contained classrooms exist when students spend more than half the school day with one teacher who provides instruction in more than half of the academic areas of the curriculum.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students are also endorsed to teach children and youth who have mild or moderate disabilities and who are verified as students with one or more of the following disabilities: developmental delay, specific learning disabilities, speech language impairment (language verification only), mild or moderate mental handicap, behavior disorders, orthopedic impairments, autism, other health impairments, traumatic brain injury, and those verified children who are placed in multi-categorical programs in grades K through 6. <span class="basic-text-bold">This program requires course work beyond a single endorsement and therefore exceeds 120 hours.</span></p>
<p class="title-1">General Information</p>
<p class="basic-text">The College offers undergraduate programs leading to a bachelor of science in education and human sciences degree in more than 40 different teaching endorsements. Some students in other UNL colleges choose to seek certification, completing a degree in their home college while meeting all requirements for teacher certification in the College of Education and Human Sciences.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Early field placement in public and private schools is a nationally recognized hallmark of the teacher education program in the College of Education and Human Sciences. While internships are a valuable enhancement to many students’ education, in the College of Education and Human Sciences, practicum experiences and student teaching are a critical and essential part of the <ins class="ins cts-1" title="Inserted by Joyce Richter - 01/15/2014 11:43am" data-cid="2" data-userid="62" data-username="Joyce Richter" data-time="1389807823092">teacher education </ins>curriculum and these must be successfully completed<del class="del cts-1" title="Deleted by Joyce Richter - 01/15/2014 11:43am" data-cid="20" data-userid="62" data-username="Joyce Richter" data-time="1389807834023"> in order to be certified in the teaching profession</del>. A student’s inability to complete these field experiences, for any reason, may adversely impact the candidate’s ability to gain admission into the College or maintain enrollment in a teacher preparation program. Students unlikely or unable to complete the field experience may be counseled to seek other opportunities where success is more attainable. (See “<ins class="ins cts-1" title="Inserted by Joyce Richter - 01/15/2014 11:44am" data-cid="23" data-userid="62" data-username="Joyce Richter" data-time="1389807848113">Criminal History Background Check Requirement</ins><del class="del cts-1" title="Deleted by Joyce Richter - 01/15/2014 11:44am" data-cid="22" data-userid="62" data-username="Joyce Richter" data-time="1389807848110">Felony and Misdemeanor Conviction</del>” and “Professional and Ethical Behavior” under the OTHER heading for additional information with respect to behaviors impacting field experience participation.)</p>
<p class="basic-text">Teacher education endorsements (or majors) are divided into field endorsements or single-subject endorsements. Field endorsements certify the candidate to teach a broader range of courses compared to single-subject endorsements, which certify the candidate to teach in one subject area only. Consequently, a teacher holding a field endorsement is typically more marketable than a teacher holding a single-subject endorsement.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Candidates may also elect to complete requirements for supplemental endorsements; these are additional endorsements that can be added to a field or single-subject endorsement but cannot be taken alone. Supplemental endorsements require additional credit hours beyond those needed for the first endorsement (field or single-subject). Teachers may increase their marketability by adding supplemental endorsements.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students may also choose to complete requirements for two endorsements simultaneously. Completing a second endorsement will require additional credit hours beyond those required for the first endorsement. Often the completion of two endorsements requires more than 120 credit hours of course work and may require additional semesters of course work. Students may contact the College Student Services Center, 105 Henzlik Hall, or their adviser, for assistance in deciding whether to complete: field or single-subject endorsements, one or more supplemental endorsements, or multiple endorsements.<del class="del cts-1" title="Deleted by Joyce Richter - 01/15/2014 11:44am" data-cid="68" data-userid="62" data-username="Joyce Richter" data-time="1389807870105">Degree at a Glance</del><del class="del cts-1" title="Deleted by Joyce Richter - 01/15/2014 11:44am" data-cid="68" data-userid="62" data-username="Joyce Richter" data-time="1389807870105">Hours</del><del class="del cts-1" title="Deleted by Joyce Richter - 01/15/2014 11:44am" data-cid="68" data-userid="62" data-username="Joyce Richter" data-time="1389807870105">ACE Requirements 30</del><del class="del cts-1" title="Deleted by Joyce Richter - 01/15/2014 11:44am" data-cid="68" data-userid="62" data-username="Joyce Richter" data-time="1389807870105">ACE 1.

These can be viewed at http://ace.unl.edu. Students will be provided a list of classes they can select from to meet each of the 10 ACE Student Learning Outcomes (SLO). There may be required courses within an education endorsement program that will also satisfy ACE requirements. Therefore, it is highly recommended that students contact their adviser prior to registering for ACE classes in order to insure that each of the class selections are in the best interest of the students’ academic program.</ins></p>
<p class="content-box-h-1">ADDITIONAL MAJOR/ENDORSEMENT REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p class="title-1">Grade Requirements in Education Programs</p>
<p class="basic-text">Requirements for completion of an undergraduate degree in a teacher preparation program include a minimum cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 2.5. Students seeking certification must also have a 2.5 GPA in their endorsement and education courses with no grade lower than a C in their pre-professional courses and no grade lower than a C+ in their professional education courses.</p>
<p class="title-2">Transfer Grades</p>
<p class="basic-text">Up to 9 hours of transfer credit with grades below C may be applied to the General Education requirements and elective classes in programs leading to the undergraduate degree in teacher preparation. Transfer grades of C- and D may not be used in the major/endorsement area courses or in the professional courses in teacher preparation programs.</p>
<p class="title-2">Pass/No Pass Grade Option–for Education Students</p>
<p class="basic-text">A student enrolled at the University may, in certain instances, take a grading option of Pass/No Pass (P/N) for a specific course. A grade of pass represents satisfactory completion of a course with a grade of C or better. Credits earned under the pass grade option count toward graduation, but no grade points are tabulated in the cumulative grade point average. Likewise, a grade of no pass is not tabulated in the grade point average. The following rules apply to students who are enrolled in teacher preparation programs who choose the Pass/No Pass option:</p>
<p class="numbered-list">1. Only one course in each subject endorsement may be taken P/N; two courses in a field endorsement may be taken P/N.</p>
<p class="numbered-list">2. Pre-professional and professional education classes may not be taken P/N unless a class already has a P/N designation.</p>
<p class="numbered-list">3. Any course in the general education requirements unless otherwise stipulated by the department of the course may be taken P/N.</p>
<p class="numbered-list">4. Total P/N credits may not exceed 12 credit hours. This limit does not include courses offered on a P/N only basis.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students who are admitted through the Admission by Review process with core course deficiencies will have certain conditions attached to their enrollment at UNL.</p>
<p class="title-2">Beyond Classroom Grades</p>
<p class="basic-text">In all fields of study, students are expected to attain certain grades and other academic accomplishments in the classroom. In addition to this, students preparing themselves to be teachers, counselors and for other careers in education, are also reviewed to evaluate their ability to successfully and safely interact with children, parents, potential educational employers, and the community-at-large, whose interest in the education of its children often exceeds its concern for other community and governmental services.</p>

<p class="title-1">Student Teaching Placement</p>
<p class="basic-text">The Office of Field Experiences is responsible for the placement of student teachers. Several factors are considered in determining the district and school to which an individual is assigned. The availability of a cooperating teacher and supervisor who meet the requirements established by the Nebraska Department of Education and the University of Nebraska–Lincoln are among those factors. Opportunities to student teach out-of-state are limited and those placements are becoming increasingly difficult. All requests to student teach outside of the immediate Lincoln area must be individually reviewed and approved by the Director of Field Experience<del class="del cts-1" title="Deleted by Joyce Richter - 01/15/2014 11:48am" data-cid="5" data-userid="62" data-username="Joyce Richter" data-time="1389808088927">s</del>.</p>
<p class="title-1">Removal from Student Teaching</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students participating in practicum or student teaching assignments may be removed from their assigned schools if their conduct suggests a lack of professional commitment and presents a negative influence on the well-being or learning of the students in the schools. Specific guidelines that all student teachers are to follow can be found in The Student Teaching Experience: A Handbook for the University of Nebraska–Lincoln.

<p class="basic-text">Any student removed from a practicum or student teaching assignment may appeal that decision by submitting a written request to the College Appeals Committee within 30 days of the removal. The Appeals Committee will schedule a meeting, request pertinent information from the Director of Field Experiences, and notify the student several days in advance of the scheduled appeal meeting. Students are advised of their right to seek legal advice and may personally attend the Appeals Committee meeting. The Committee’s decision will be forwarded in writing to the student, to the Director of Field Experience<del class="del cts-1" title="Deleted by Joyce Richter - 01/15/2014 11:48am" data-cid="13" data-userid="62" data-username="Joyce Richter" data-time="1389808110807">s</del>, and to the Dean of the College.</p>
<p class="title-1">Praxis II</p>
<p class="basic-text">All students completing a program leading to a teaching certificate with an endorsement in elementary grades (grades K-6) will be required to take the EECIA-00011 version of Praxis II before graduation.

If a student fails to complete at least one half of the student teaching assignment, the individual will be required to complete a culminating project not to exceed 6 credit hours.</del><del class="del cts-1" title="Deleted by Joyce Richter - 01/15/2014 11:48am" data-cid="14" data-userid="62" data-username="Joyce Richter" data-time="1389808127967"><span class="basic-text-bold">Any student who graduates without a recommendation for certification will not be recommended for teacher certification in any state.</span></del><del class="del cts-1" title="Deleted by Joyce Richter - 01/15/2014 11:48am" data-cid="14" data-userid="62" data-username="Joyce Richter" data-time="1389808127967"> In addition, the student will not be eligible for graduation with honors.

In addition, the Department of Health and Human Services has created its own set of standards that apply to all individuals working in any capacity with pre-school children who are not yet in kindergarten. To comply with these two sets of standards, the College of Education and Human Sciences will require each student in a teacher education program to complete two formal reviews of their criminal history, which is conducted by the approved CEHS vender. The first review will be completed during the first semester of the individual's entry into the College. This must be completed before one's first field experience. The second criminal history background check will take place as part of the student teaching application process, culminating experience, or internship. Each student is responsible for the cost of the two criminal history reviews. If more than three years elapse after the initial background check is conducted, the College reserves the right to require that one or more additional background checks be completed. Eighteen months after the initial Criminal History Background Check, undergraduate students are required to complete the CEDHS self-disclosure report. Graduate students will be required to complete the self-disclosure report at the same time the initial background check is conducted.</ins></p>

A student's ability to continue to participate in any teacher education program in the College will be based on the type and number of convictions, the recentness of their occurrence, and whether or not they are in violation of the requirements of the Department of Health and Human Services and/or the Nebraska Department of Education standards as they apply to working with pre-school and school age youth. </ins></p>

<p class="basic-text">In additional to criminal convictions, other non-criminal behaviors which: involve risks that are unacceptable for future teachers and the children charged to their care; demonstrate a lack of professionalism and good judgment; and evidence a disregard for one’s personal reputation, the integrity of the College and the teaching profession, may bring into question a student’s ability to be successful in an education career. Before engaging in such questionable behavior, students must consider how the College, the profession, educational employer, parents of school-aged children, and the community which is the State of Nebraska, would perceive or evaluate the impact of that behavior with respect to the students’ ability to serve children. To be allowed to teach is a great honor and a great responsibility. Teaching is a profession that requires its potential candidates to be individuals of the highest integrity. Prospective teachers must be able to demonstrate that they are individuals of strong moral character who can make mature decisions for themselves and for their students. They serve as important role models and mentors for children during very impressionable years. Teachers are responsible for the education, safety and well-being for anyone in their charge. Indeed, teachers hold the future of all in their care. Therefore, the College of Education and Human Sciences is most interested in training future teachers who show a high degree of moral character and the ability to act responsibly. These individuals must be able to serve as representatives of our College and the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. These standards and practices also apply to individuals in CEHS programs intended to serve children in a community setting.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Should the College, through the reasonable exercise of the judgment of its Certification Officer or the Director of Field Experience, determine that a student’s individual behavior represents a lack of integrity, questionable moral/ethical character, or otherwise indicates a potential of risk to young persons and others in the educational community, the College of Education and Human Sciences reserves the right to deny entry to or dismiss such a student from any program which leads to certification or to service of children in a community agency. More specifically, these kinds of behavior shall be adequate foundation to deny any candidate or potential candidate from participation in any practicum, pre-practicum, student teaching or similar field experience, since the interests and safety of the children, and young people present in the classroom, schools and other venues where these practicum experiences take place are paramount.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Problematic behaviors, which the College of Education and Human Sciences reasonably determines renders the candidate a risk to the educational community or demonstrates a likelihood of illegal activity, may be established by any credible means, including the facts surrounding a record of arrests and/or convictions.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Similarly, behaviors which result in a finding by a court or other governmental body that the individual is:</p>
<ul>
<li>a mentally ill and dangerous person;</li>
<li>mentally incompetent to stand trial;</li>
<li>acquitted of criminal charges because of insanity;</li>
<li>an incapacitated person;</li>
<li>a person in need of a guardian or conservator, or;</li>
<li>a person unable to manage his or her property due to mental illness, mental deficiency, or chronic use of drugs or chronic intoxication are the kind of behaviors which are likely to disqualify a candidate from participation in practicum experiences and other College of Education and Human Sciences programs.</li>
</ul>
<p class="basic-text">Similar to the discussion concerning criminal convictions above, the consequences for unprofessional, unethical or risky behavior will very likely be different in each case, due to the unique circumstances involved in each matter. The College reserves its prerogative to evaluate students’ fitness for the profession in its discretion, so that safety in the classroom, the reputation of the College, and the best interest of the student, are all recognized and promoted.</p>
<p class="title-2">Appeal to the Dean</p>
<p class="basic-text">Should a student object to the determination made by the Certification Officer or the Director of Field Experience with respect to a criminal behavior matter, the student may appeal to the Dean of the College, in writing within no greater than ten days of the determination, requesting the Dean of the College to investigate and review the determination. The student’s written appeal shall clearly explain to the Dean the basis for the student’s appeal. The Dean will review the student’s basis for appeal, and is authorized, but not required to look into related concerns, whether or not sure concerns are contained in the student’s written appeal. The Dean is authorized to collect such additional information as she or he deems necessary to review an investigation (including but not limited to the student’s educational records maintained by the College, other documentation, personal interviews and meetings with the student, College faculty, administration and staff, and others with relevant information). The Dean shall render a decision on the appeal as soon as reasonably possibly, but in no case longer than 20 days following the initiation of the appeal. Once the Dean has completed the review and investigation, he or she shall deliver to the student and the Certification Officer or the Director of Field Experience or both, a written decision, which decision shall be final and not subject to further appeal or review within the University of Nebraska.</p>            </div>
